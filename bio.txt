Hello, my name is Vera Wolf and I am a current student (emerging professional) with the Year Up program. I am currently learning Software Development. Prior to Year up I was in the military for a few years then found a civilian job as an engraver, and that is where my love for Software Devlopment began. I learned programs such as Corel and Engrave Lab, but it wasn't enough. I want to be able to do and create more and that is what brought me to my current path.
